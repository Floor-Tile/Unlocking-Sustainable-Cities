    <h1>Bio City Manifesto</h1>
    <ul>1.	The third pillar, the bio city, requires a fundamentally new relationship between humans and nature, and a changing understanding of ourselves as humans.</ul>
    <ul>2.	This is a generational task and will require a fundamental redesign of how we approach education.</ul>
    <ul>3.	Restoring and regenerating urban nature needs to become central drivers of all urban development decisions, especially in the context of promoting climate safe and resilient cities.</ul>
    <ul>4.	Biophilic and biomimetic design are key to help us reconnect with, learn from and emulate natural processes in cities in ways that can underpin human flourishing.</ul>
    <ul>5.	Natural features ranging from linear parks and vertical walls to rain gardens and breathing buildings offer a whole basket of benefits and need to be built in and retrofitted to all urban developments.</ul>
    <ul>6.	Due to their proximity and daily experiences, local residents are best placed to steward and regenerate nature in their communities.</ul>
    <ul>7.	Connecting and enhancing blue and green urban infrastructures can unlock the significant potential of urban nature, and embed water sensitive design that can tackle extreme weather changes.</ul>
    <ul>8.	All options and potentials for food growing within urban spaces need to be unlocked, especially in ways that foster significant changes in urban forms and functions.</ul>
    <ul>9.	Given the rapid annihilation of animal species globally, spaces for urban wildlife require urgently protecting and enhancing.</ul>
