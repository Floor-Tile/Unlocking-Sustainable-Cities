      <p>The very ecosystems that cities depend upon are being intensely degraded. The whole idea of cities as natural places is now deeply questionable. Given the biospheric, biodiversity and climatic threats ahead, urgent effort is required to focus on the lock-down of ecosystem degradation, resource depletion, and the commodification of natural resources. We urgently need to create climate safe and resilient cities, and in ways that ensure a new basis for human development. More fundamentally, there is a huge rift between the natural and the urban worlds. There needs to be a radical new human-nature deal based on equality, stewardship, ecological restoration and non-commodified relations.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is the Bio City which unlocks emerging trends through a radical emerging approach to urban nature including urban rewilding, permaculture, biomimicry, biophilia, urban agriculture, continuous productive urban landscapes, and blue-green infrastructure. Only by deeply reconnecting with nature can we tackle the sustainability crisis ahead.
