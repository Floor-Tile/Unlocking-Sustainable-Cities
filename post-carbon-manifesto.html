    <h1>Post Carbon City Manifesto</h1>
    <ul>1.	The second pillar, the post-carbon city, requires holistic and interconnected action and ideas across a broad range of areas: infrastructure, work, governance, culture, education leisure, mobility, health.</ul>
    <ul>2.	Municipalities will play a key role in setting ambitious net zero carbon and renewable energy plans, and they will require significant new powers to prohibit polluting and climate unsafe activities.</ul>
    <ul>3.	City owned entities need to lead the way in creating and distributing affordable, locally generated green energy.</ul>
    <ul>4.	All new neighbourhood planning needs to reorienting around zero carbon living arrangements, designing out energy use and designing in low impact travel, work and leisure options.</ul>
    <ul>5.	Primary legislation will be required to break up the brown fuel sector.</ul>
    <ul>6.	A huge subsidy transfer is required away from centralised and corporate energy providers to a constellation of civic energy ones.</ul>
    <ul>7.	Difficult choices need to be pursued to curtail and reduce energy demand, especially around hyper-consumerism and poor city zoning.</ul>
    <ul>8.	The potential of civic energy needs unleashing through regulatory changes and stimulating innovation so that every building becomes a power station.</ul>
    <ul>9.	Citizen groups are best placed to design, implement and manage local energy systems. Their power needs unleashing through enabling finance and regulations so they can lead the civic energy revolution.</ul>
    <ul>10.	Given the scale of the task and the sluggishness of the response in the face of mounting climate breakdown, coalitions of groups taking direct action will play a role in the lock down unsustainable and dangerous activities.</ul>
